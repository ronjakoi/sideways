# Sideways

Sideways is a small personal project. Its purpose is to learn some game programming in Rust.

## Prerequisites

For building on Linux you will need the development libraries of SDL2. For example in Ubuntu or Debian:

`sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev`

You will also need the Rust development tools, `rustc` and `cargo`.
The easiest way to install these is by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

## Building and running the game

`cargo run`

## How to play

Use the arrow keys to fly your ship. Press S or Space to fire your weapon.

## Things not implemented

* Enemies that shoot
* More varied enemies
* Terrain
* Levels
* Dying
* Menus
* Sound effects and music
* EXPLOSIONS
